Policy Statement\n\nThis SERVICE does not access, track, collect, retain, use, or disclose any USER INFORMATION or USER DATA.\n\n2. Do Not Track\n\nUSERS contacting SCRIBE to ask that their USER INFORMATION and USER DATA not be tracked will be provided with a copy of this POLICY as well as a link to all source codes as proof that they are not being tracked.\n\n3. Third-Party Data\n\nThis SERVICE makes use of third-party data. All data used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the data for this SERVICE comes from Wikidata, Wikipedia and Unicode. Wikidata states that, \"All structured data in the main, property and lexeme namespaces is made available under the Creative Commons CC0 License; text in other namespaces is made available under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License.\" The policy detailing Wikidata data usage can be found at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Licensing.

Third-Party Source Code\n\nThis SERVICE was based on third-party code. All source code used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the basis of this project was the project CustomKeyboard by Ethan Sarif-Kattan.

This service is covered by an Apache License 2.0, which states that it is available for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use. The license for the aforementioned service can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/LICENSE.\n\n6.
